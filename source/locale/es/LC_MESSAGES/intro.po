"The 'Quite universal circuit simulator' Qucs (pronounced: kju:ks) is an "
"open source circuit simulator developed by a group of engineers, "
"scientists and mathematicians under the GNU General Public License (GPL)."
" Qucs is the brain-child of German Engineers Michael Margraf and Stefan "
"Jahn.  Since its initial public release in 2003 around twenty "
"contributors, from all regions of the world, have invested their "
"expertise and time to support the development of the software. Both "
"binary and source code releases take place at regular intervals. Qucs "
"numbered releases and day-to-day development code snapshots can be "
"downloaded from (`<http://qucs.sourceforge.net>`_).  Versions are "
"available for Linux (Ubuntu and other distributions), Mac OS X |copy| and"
" the Windows |copy| 32 bit operating system."

"In the period since Qucs was first released it has evolved into an "
"advanced circuit simulation and device modelling tool with a user "
"friendly \"graphical user interface\" (GUI) for circuit schematic "
"capture, for investigating circuit and device properties from DC to RF "
"and beyond, and for launching other circuit simulation software, "
"including the FreeHDL (VHDL) and Icarus Verilog digital simulators.  Qucs"
" includes built-in code for processing and visualising simulation output "
"data. Qucs also allows users to process post-simulation data with the "
"popular Octave numerical data analysis package. Similarly, circuit "
"performance optimisation is possible using the A SPICE Circuit Optimizer "
"(ASCO) package or Python code linked to Qucs."

"Between 2003, and January 2015, the sourceforge Qucs download statistics "
"show that over one million downloads of the software have been recorded."
"  As well as extensive circuit simulation capabilities Qucs supports a "
"full range of device modelling features, including non-linear and RF "
"equation-defined device modelling and the use of the Verilog-A hardware "
"description language (HDL) for compact device modelling and "
"macromodelling.  Recent extensions to the software aim to diversify the "
"Qucs modelling facilities by running the Berkeley \"Model and Algorithm "
"Prototyping Platform\" (MAPP) in parallel with Qucs, using Octave "
"launched from the Qucs GUI. In the future, as the Qucs project evolves, "
"the software will also provide circuit designers with a choice of "
"simulation engine selected from the Qucs built-in code, ngspice and Xyce "
"|copy|."

"Qucs is a large software package which takes time to learn. Incidentally,"
" this statement is also true for other GPL circuit simulators. New users "
"must realise that to get the best from the software some effort is "
"required on their part. In particular, one of the best ways to become "
"familiar with Qucs is to learn a few basic user rules and how to apply "
"them.  Once these have been mastered users can move on with confidence to"
" next level of understanding. Eventually, a stage will be reached which "
"allows Qucs to be used productively to model devices and to investigate "
"the performance of circuits.   Qucs is equally easy to use by absolute "
"beginners, like school children learning the physics of electrical "
"circuits consisting of a battery and one or more resistors, as it is by "
"cutting edge engineers working on the modelling of sub-nano sized RF MOS "
"transistors with hundreds of physical parameters."

"The primary purpose of these notes is to provide Qucs users with a source"
" of reference for the operation and capabilities of the software.  The "
"information provided also indicates any known limitations and, if "
"available, provides details of any work-arounds.  Qucs is a high level "
"scientific/engineering tool who's operation and performance does require "
"users to understand the basic mathematical, scientific and engineering "
"principles underlying the operation of electronic devices and the design "
"and analysis of electronic circuits.   Hence, the individual sections of "
"the Qucs-Help document include material of a technical nature mixed in "
"with details of the software operation.   Most sections introduce a "
"number of worked design and simulation examples. These have been graded "
"to help readers with different levels of understand get the best from the"
" Qucs circuit simulator.   Qucs-Help is a dynamic document which will "
"change with every new release of the Qucs software. At this time, Qucs "
"release 0.0.19, the document is far from complete but given time it will "
"improve."
