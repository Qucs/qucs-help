"If the marker points to a variable called \"Sopt\", the menu shows the "
"option \"noise matching\". Note that the only different to \"power "
"matching\" is the fact that the conjugate complex reflexion coefficient "
"is taken. So if the variable has another name, noise matching can be "
"chosen by re-adjusting the values in the dialog."

"If the variable name in the marker text is an S-parameter, then an option"
" exists for concurrently matching input and output of a two-port circuit."
" This works quite alike the above-mentioned steps. It results in two "
"L-circuits: The very left node is for connecting port 1, the very right "
"node is for connectiong port 2 and the two node in the middle are for "
"connecting the two-port circuit."
