Chapter 1. Introduction
-------------------------------
Following the release of Qucs-0.0.18 in August 2014 the Qucs Development Team considered in detail
a number of possible directions that future versions of the software could take. Spice4qucs is one of these
routes. It addresses a number of problems observed with the current version of Qucs while attempting
to combine some of the best features of other GPL circuit simulation packages with Qucs and expands the available device
and component modelling tools provided with Qucs.  Qucs was originally written as an RF and microwave engineering design tool
which provided features not found in SPICE, like S parameter simulation, two and multi-port AC circuit analysis and RF network synthesis. 
Since it was first release under the General Public License (GPL) in 2003 Qucs has provided users with a stable, flexible and reasonably 
functional circuit simulation package which is particularly suited for high frequency circuit simulation. In the years following 2003 the Qucs Development team 
added a number of additional simulation facilities, including for example, transient simulation,  device parameter sweep capabilities and single
tone Harmonic Balance simulation, making Qucs functionality comparable to SPICE at low frequencies and extended at high frequencies. 
Considerable effort has also been made to improve the device modelling tools distributed with Qucs.
Today features for algebraic equation manipulation, Equation-Defined Device (EDD) modelling, Radio Frequency Equation-Defined Device simulation and Verilog-A synthesised model development
plus a range of compact and behavioural device modelling and post simulation data analysis tools provide users with an open source software package of surprising power and utility. 

One of the most often requested new Qucs features is for "better documentation", especially documentation introducing the use and limitations of the simulation and
modelling features built into Qucs.  Qucs is a large and complex package which is very flexible in the way that it can be used as a circuit design aid. Hence, however much 
documentation is written outlining its functionality there are always likely be simulation and modelling examples that are missing from the Qucs documentation. In the future
all Qucs releases will be accompanied by two basic Qucs documents. The first of these, simply called "Qucs-Help", provides introductory information for beginners and 
other interested users, who require help in starting to use Qucs. The second Qucs document, called "Spice4qucs-Help",
introduces more advanced simulation and modelling topics.  Both documents present a large number of typical circuit simulation and compact device modelling examples.
In the text these are also linked to a detailed set of Qucs reference material.  Since 2003 the Qucs Development Team, and other authors, have published a body of work concerning Qucs and it's
applications. A bibliography of these publications can be found at the end of this document. Anyone interested in learning about Qucs is recommended to read these publications as they provide 
a wealth of additional information on many basic and advanced Qucs topics.  Both the "Qucs_Help" and "Spice4qucs-Help" documents are very much work in progress. 
Updated versions will be published with each new Qucs release. Moreover, to keep everyone up to date with Qucs current developments they will also be updated during Qucs development phases.
