"There is no big difference in running an analog or a digital simulation. So "
"having read the `Getting Started for analog simulations <start.html>`__, it "
"is now easy to get a digital simulation work. Let us compute the truth table"
" of a simple logical AND cell. Select the digital components in the combobox"
" of the components tab on the left-hand side and build the circuit shown in "
"figure 1. The digital simulation block can be found among the other "
"simulation blocks."

"Congratulation, the first digital simulation is done!"

"A truth table is not the only digital simulation that Qucs can perform. It "
"is also possible to apply an arbitrary signal to a circuit and see the "
"output signal in a timing diagram. To do so, the parameter *Type* of the "
"simulation block must be changed to *TimeList* and the duration of the "
"simulation must be entered in the next parameter. The digital sources have "
"now a different meaning: They can output an arbitrary bit sequence by "
"defining the first bit (low or high) and a list that sets the times until "
"the next change of state. Note that this list repeats itself after its end. "
"So, to create a 1GHz clock with pulse ratio 1:1, the list writes: 0.5ns; "
"0.5ns"

"More complex and more universal simulations can be performed using the "
"component \"VHDL file\". This component can be picked up from the component "

"usage is the following: The VHDL file should be a member of the project. "
"Then go to the content list view and click on the file name. After entering "

"The last entity block in the VHDL file defines the interface, that is, all "
"input and output ports must be declared here. These ports are also shown by "
"the schematic symbol and can be connected to the rest of the circuit. During"
" simulation the source code of the VHDL file is placed into the top-level "
"VHDL file. This must be considered as it causes some limitations. For "
"example, the entity names within the VHDL file must differ from names "
"already given to subcircuits. (After a simulation, the complete source code "
"can be seen by pressing F6. Use it to get a feeling for this procedure.)"
