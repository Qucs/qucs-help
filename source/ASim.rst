5.1 Fourier simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The SPICE implementation of *Fourier analysis* allows users to perform a Fourier transform of
one or more time domain circuit signals and to investigate their spectrum in the frequency domain. 
SPICE *Fourier analysis* is implemented by both Ngspice and Xyce. 
Fourier simulation is available to spice4qucs users via a special icon called *Fourier 
analysis*. This simulation icon is located in the *Spice simulations* group. To request a *Fourier analysis*
place a copy of the *"Fourier analysis"*  icon on the current work schematic alongside a *Transient analysis* icon.  
SPICE *Fourier analysis* uses the simulation data generated by a transient simulation and has no meaning without a set of transient
simulation time domain data.  The link between Fourier analysis and transient simulation is formed by entering the 
name of the coupled transient simulation as the first property of *Fourier analysis*. 

The *Fourier analysis* property list has the following entries:

#. ``Sim``     --- Linked transient analysis icon name.
#. ``numfreq`` --- Number of harmonics: variable number for ngspice and fixed at 10 for Xyce.
#. ``F0``      --- This parameter is the fundamental frequency of the generated frequency domain spectrum.
#. ``Vars``    --- This parameter is a list of output signals. Output signals may be node voltages and currents. In the list each entry should be space separated. 

Fourier simulation creates four output vectors for each specified output signal, for 
example in the case of ``v(out)``:

#. ``magnitude(v(out))``  --- Magnitude spectrum.
#. ``phase(v(out))``      --- Phase spectrum (in degrees--).
#. ``norm(mag(v(out))``   --- Normalized magnitude spectrum.
#. ``norm(phase(v(out))`` --- Normalized phase spectrum.

Spice4qucs allows each of these four display vectors to be plotted. 

Here is a small example of a *Fourier analysis* which demonstrates the main features introduced above 
and the relation between small signal AC simulation and *Fourier analysis*.

5.2 Distortion simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SPICE *Distortion analysis* provides a small signal distortion analysis of a circuit being simulated. 
To request a distortion analysis place a copy of the special *Distortion analysis* icon on the current work schematic. 
It undertakes a simulation similar to the small signal *AC analysis*, but calculates the circuit distortion 
components instead. SPICE *Distortion analysis* is only available with ngspice. The calculated distortion components, 
for example values for the second and third harmonic components, can be extracted using ngnutmeg script statements. 
Refer to the official ngspice manual for the details of the available ngnutmeg operators and functions.

Ngspice *Distortion analysis* requires that the circuit being simulated is driven by aspecial *AC voltage* source component. 
This extended signal source can be found in the *Spice components* group. You need to specify voltage source parameters ``DISTOF1`` and/or 
``DISTOF2`` for the ngspice  *Distortion analysis* to function correctly. Refer to the official ngspice manual for 
a detailed description of all the ngspice *Distortion analysis* features. Please NOTE that the standard Qucs AC source will not work 
with ngspice *Distortion analysis*.

Here is an basic example of the application of SPICE *Distortion analysis* for estimating the distortion components of a 
single stage transistor amplifier.

5.3 Noise simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SPICE noise simulation allows the calculation of total circuit noise over a specified frequency bandwidth. 
ngspice noise simulation creates two vectors:

#. ``onoise_total`` --- Integrated output noise.
#. ``inoise_total`` --- Equivalent input noise.

Spice4qucs allows these vectors to be plotted. NOTE the Noise simulation at a single signal
frequency only outputs a single set of noise data. At this time only ngspice has noise analysis
implemented. However, in the near future is expected that noise simulation will be added to Xyce.

To set up a *Noise analysis* add the following four parameters to the *Noise analysis* icon
drop-down list:

#. ``Bandwidth limits`` --- Analysis start and stop frequencies in Hz.
#. ``Points count``     --- The number of noise simulation frequency points.
#. ``Output`` --- The output parameter name; this may be a node voltage or branch current.
#. ``Source``           --- Name of the input voltage source. A standard Qucs voltage source is allowed in this context.

5.4 One and two parameter sweep controlled simulations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use both one and two parameter (in nested loops) sweep with Ngspice and 
Xyce. There is no warranty of proper results for Xyce and Parameter sweep with 
Time-domain simulation, because Xyce uses adaptive time step for each step of 
sweep variable. Parameter sweep for DC and frequency domain works properly. 

There are the following differences between Qucs and Spice4qucs parameter sweep 
definitions.

#. You should use component name instead of variable to sweep component value. 
   For example you should use ``C1``, ``R1``, etc. to sweep values of C1 and R1 
   values.  
#. You can sweep component model parameter value with Ngspice. You should use 
   the following    notation ``Component_name.Parameter_name``. For example 
   ``T1.Bf`` will sweep  the ``Bf`` parameter of the transistor ``T1``. 
#. You cannot use ``.PARAM`` and ``.GLOBAL_PARAM`` names as sweep variables.

There is a small example of parameter sweep usage. Sweep variable is collector 
resistor R2. It is specified in Parameter Sweep properties.

5.5 Qucs and SPICE simulation of device and circuit temperature properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

5.6 Spectrum analysis with Ngspice and Nutmeg scripting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Qucs-S have no unified simulation type **"Spectrum analysis"** for all simulation
backends. But you may use Nutmeg scripting to implement Spectrum analysis if
Ngspice or SpiceOpus is selected as the default simulation kernel. 

Let's consider double balanced passive diode mixer circuit.

.. image:: _static/en/chapter5/mixer.png

Figure 5.6 Diode double balanced mixer simulation

Balanced mixer circuit has two inputs: local oscillator
:math:`f_{LO}=15\mathrm{MHz}` and RF signal :math:`f_{RF}=7\mathrm{MHz}` 
and gives a set of signals at the outputs. Transformer models are taken from the
**Transformer** library form the Qucs-S distribution.  Output signal
contains components with the following frequencies:

.. math::
 f_{out}= \pm m f_{RF} \pm n f_{LO}\qquad \mathrm{where}\quad m,n \neq 0

The following two components are the strongest (upper IF and lower IF
respectively):

.. math::
 f_{IF2} = f_{LO} + f_{RF}

.. math::
 f_{IF1} = f_{LO} - f_{RF}

We should these signals as peaks at the spectrum.

It's need to use Nutmeg scripting to obtain the spectrum. **Nutmeg script**
component serves for this purpose at the presented circuit. Let's consider
Nutmeg script structure. Such structure is need to be used for every spectrum
analysis. Nutmeg script source code is presented here:


.. code-block:: Bash
 :linenos:

 tran 1n 10u 0
 linearize v(out)
 fft V(out)
 let S = db(v(out))

Spectrum calculation is performed by the ``fft()`` operator at the line #3.
The argument of this function is transient simulation result vector (voltage or
current). And it's need to perform a transient simulation before.
Transient simulation is performed at the line #1. Simulation step is :math:`t_s=1\mathrm{ns}`
and duration is :math:`T_d=10\mathrm{\mu s}`. This gives 

.. math::
 N = \frac{T_d}{2t_s} = \frac{10\,\mathrm{\mu s}}{2 \cdot 1\,\mathrm{ns}} =5000

spectrum points.

Frequency step will be:

.. math::
 F = \frac{1}{2 N t_s} = 100 \mathrm{kHz}

We can summarize that the smallest timestep and the longest duration gives the
most precise frequency step and spectrum analysis precision. But it increases
the simulation time.

Ngspice uses dynamic timestep calculation at simulation time. And real timestep
may differ from the specified in the ``tran`` statement. It's need to perform
simulation analysis linearization. Line#2 linearizes simulation result (output
voltage ``V(out)``). Vector ``V(out)`` contains now linearized transient simulation
result and could be passed to the ``fft()`` input (line #3).


After FFT we can plot ``V(out)`` vector and see spectrum. But we can apply any
postprocessing to it. For example we can express spectrum in decibels (dB) with
``dB()`` nutmeg function (line #4, ``S`` variable). You need to specify these
two variables in the Nutmeg script properties (Figure 5.7)

Simulation results are shown in the Figure 5.8. Both spectrum and logarithmic
spectrum (dB) are shown.
