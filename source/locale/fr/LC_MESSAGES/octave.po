"If the user creates a new text document and saves it with the Octave "
"extension, e.g. 'name.m' then the file will be listed at the Octave files"
" of the active project. The script can be executed with F2 key or by "
"pressing the simulate button in the toolbar. The output can bee seen in "
"the Octave window that opens automatically (per default on the right-hand"
" side). At the bottom of the Octave window there is a command line where "
"the user can enter single commands. It has a history function that can be"
" used with the cursor up/down keys."

"Octave can also be used for automatic postprocessing of a Qucs simulation"
" result. This is done by editing the data display file of a schematic "
"(Document Settings... in File menu). If the filename of an Octave script "
"(filename extension m) from the same project is entered, this script will"
" be executed after the simulation is finished."
