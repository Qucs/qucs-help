"The 'Quite universal circuit simulator' Qucs (pronounced: kju:ks) is an open"
" source circuit simulator developed by a group of engineers, scientists and "
"mathematicians under the GNU General Public License (GPL). Qucs is the "
"brain-child of German Engineers Michael Margraf and Stefan Jahn.  Since its "
"initial public release in 2003 around twenty contributors, from all regions "
"of the world, have invested their expertise and time to support the "
"development of the software. Both binary and source code releases take place"
" at regular intervals. Qucs numbered releases and day-to-day development "
"code snapshots can be downloaded from (`<http://qucs.sourceforge.net>`_).  "
"Versions are available for Linux (Ubuntu and other distributions), Mac OS X "
"|copy| and the Windows |copy| 32 bit operating system."

"In the period since Qucs was first released it has evolved into an advanced "
"circuit simulation and device modelling tool with a user friendly "
"\"graphical user interface\" (GUI) for circuit schematic capture, for "
"investigating circuit and device properties from DC to RF and beyond, and "
"for launching other circuit simulation software, including the FreeHDL "
"(VHDL) and Icarus Verilog digital simulators.  Qucs includes built-in code "
"for processing and visualising simulation output data. Qucs also allows "
"users to process post-simulation data with the popular Octave numerical data"
" analysis package. Similarly, circuit performance optimisation is possible "
"using the A SPICE Circuit Optimizer (ASCO) package or Python code linked to "
"Qucs."

"Between 2003, and January 2015, the sourceforge Qucs download statistics "
"show that over one million downloads of the software have been recorded.  As"
" well as extensive circuit simulation capabilities Qucs supports a full "
"range of device modelling features, including non-linear and RF equation-"
"defined device modelling and the use of the Verilog-A hardware description "
"language (HDL) for compact device modelling and macromodelling.  Recent "
"extensions to the software aim to diversify the Qucs modelling facilities by"
" running the Berkeley \"Model and Algorithm Prototyping Platform\" (MAPP) in"
" parallel with Qucs, using Octave launched from the Qucs GUI. In the future,"
" as the Qucs project evolves, the software will also provide circuit "
"designers with a choice of simulation engine selected from the Qucs built-in"
" code, ngspice and Xyce |copy|."

"Qucs is a large software package which takes time to learn. Incidentally, "
"this statement is also true for other GPL circuit simulators. New users must"
" realise that to get the best from the software some effort is required on "
"their part. In particular, one of the best ways to become familiar with Qucs"
" is to learn a few basic user rules and how to apply them.  Once these have "
"been mastered users can move on with confidence to next level of "
"understanding. Eventually, a stage will be reached which allows Qucs to be "
"used productively to model devices and to investigate the performance of "
"circuits.   Qucs is equally easy to use by absolute beginners, like school "
"children learning the physics of electrical circuits consisting of a battery"
" and one or more resistors, as it is by cutting edge engineers working on "
"the modelling of sub-nano sized RF MOS transistors with hundreds of physical"
" parameters."

"The primary purpose of these notes is to provide Qucs users with a source of"
" reference for the operation and capabilities of the software.  The "
"information provided also indicates any known limitations and, if available,"
" provides details of any work-arounds.  Qucs is a high level "
"scientific/engineering tool who's operation and performance does require "
"users to understand the basic mathematical, scientific and engineering "
"principles underlying the operation of electronic devices and the design and"
" analysis of electronic circuits.   Hence, the individual sections of the "
"Qucs-Help document include material of a technical nature mixed in with "
"details of the software operation.   Most sections introduce a number of "
"worked design and simulation examples. These have been graded to help "
"readers with different levels of understand get the best from the Qucs "
"circuit simulator.   Qucs-Help is a dynamic document which will change with "
"every new release of the Qucs software. At this time, Qucs release 0.0.19, "
"the document is far from complete but given time it will improve."
