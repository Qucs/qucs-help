msgid "For circuit optimization, Qucs uses the ASCO tool "
"(`http://asco.sourceforge.net/ <http://asco.sourceforge.net/>`__). A brief "
"description on how to prepare your schematic, execute and interprete the "
"results is given below. Before using this functionality, ASCO must be "
"installed on the computer."

msgid "Optimization of a circuit is nothing more than the minimization of a cost "
"function. It can either be the delay or the rise time of a digital circuit, "
"or the power or gain of an analog circuit. Another possibility is defining "
"the optimization problem as a composition of functions, leading in this case"
" to the definition of a figure-of-merit."

msgid "To setup a netlist for optimization two things must be added to the already "
"existing netlist: insert equation(s) and the optimization component block. "
"Take the schematic from Figure 1 and change it until you have the resulting "
"schematic given in Figure 2."

"the existing parameters, special attention should be paid to 'Maximum number"
" of iterations', 'Constant F' and 'Crossing over factor'. Over- or "
"underestimation can lead to a premature convergence of the optimizer to a "
"local minimum or, a very long optimization time."
