"For digital simulations Qucs uses the FreeHDL program "
"(`http://www.freehdl.seul.org <http://www.freehdl.seul.org>`_). So the "

"There is no big difference in running an analog or a digital simulation. "
"So having read the `Getting Started for analog simulations "
"<start.html>`_, it is now easy to get a digital simulation work. Let us "
"compute the truth table of a simple logical AND cell. Select the digital "
"components in the combobox of the components tab on the left-hand side "
"and build the circuit shown in figure 1. The digital simulation block can"
" be found among the other simulation blocks."

"The digital sources *S1* and *S2* are the inputs, the node labeled as "
"*Output* is the output. After performing the simulation, the data display"
" page opens. Place the diagram *truth table* on it and insert the "
"variable *Output*. Now the truth table of a two-port AND cell is shown. "
"Congratulation, the first digital simulation is done!"

"A truth table is not the only digital simulation that Qucs can perform. "
"It is also possible to apply an arbitrary signal to a circuit and see the"
" output signal in a timing diagram. To do so, the parameter *Type* of the"
" simulation block must be changed to *TimeList* and the duration of the "
"simulation must be entered in the next parameter. The digital sources "
"have now a different meaning: They can output an arbitrary bit sequence "
"by defining the first bit (low or high) and a list that sets the times "
"until the next change of state. Note that this list repeats itself after "
"its end. So, to create a 1GHz clock with pulse ratio 1:1, the list "
"writes: 0.5ns; 0.5ns"

"More complex and more universal simulations can be performed using the "
"component \"VHDL file\". This component can be picked up from the "
"component list view (section \"digital components\"). Nevertheless the "
"recommended usage is the following: The VHDL file should be a member of "
"the project. Then go to the content list view and click on the file name."
" After entering the schematic area, the VHDL component can be placed."

"The last entity block in the VHDL file defines the interface, that is, "
"all input and output ports must be declared here. These ports are also "
"shown by the schematic symbol and can be connected to the rest of the "
"circuit. During simulation the source code of the VHDL file is placed "
"into the top-level VHDL file. This must be considered as it causes some "
"limitations. For example, the entity names within the VHDL file must "
"differ from names already given to subcircuits. (After a simulation, the "
"complete source code can be seen by pressing F6. Use it to get a feeling "
"for this procedure.)"
