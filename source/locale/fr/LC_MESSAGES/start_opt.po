"For circuit optimization, Qucs uses the ASCO tool "
"(`http://asco.sourceforge.net/ <http://asco.sourceforge.net/>`__). A brief "
"description on how to prepare your schematic, execute and interprete the "
"results is given below. Before using this functionality, ASCO must be "

"Optimization of a circuit is nothing more than the minimization of a cost "
"function. It can either be the delay or the rise time of a digital circuit, "
"or the power or gain of an analog circuit. Another possibility is defining "
"the optimization problem as a composition of functions, leading in this case"
" to the definition of a figure-of-merit."
