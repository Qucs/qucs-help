"For circuit optimization, Qucs uses the ASCO tool "
"(`http://asco.sourceforge.net/ <http://asco.sourceforge.net/>`__). A "
"brief description on how to prepare your schematic, execute and "
"interprete the results is given below. Before using this functionality, "
"ASCO must be installed on the computer."

"Optimization of a circuit is nothing more than the minimization of a cost"
" function. It can either be the delay or the rise time of a digital "
"circuit, or the power or gain of an analog circuit. Another possibility "
"is defining the optimization problem as a composition of functions, "
"leading in this case to the definition of a figure-of-merit."

"To setup a netlist for optimization two things must be added to the "
"already existing netlist: insert equation(s) and the optimization "
"component block. Take the schematic from Figure 1 and change it until you"
" have the resulting schematic given in Figure 2."

"'Maximum number of iterations', 'Constant F' and 'Crossing over factor'. "
