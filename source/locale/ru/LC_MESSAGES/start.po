"Qucs is a scientific/engineering software package for analogue and digital "
"circuit simulation, including linear and non-linear DC analysis, small "
"signal S parameter circuit analysis, time domain transient analysis and "
"VHDL/Verilog digital circuit simulation. This section of the Qucs-Help "
"document introduces readers to the basic steps involved in Qucs analogue "
"circuit simulation. When Qucs is launched for the first time, it creates a "
"directory called ``.qucs`` within the user's home directory. All files "
"involved in Qucs simulations are saved in the ``.qucs`` directory or in one "
"of it's  sub-directories. After Qucs has been launched, the software "
"displays a Graphical User Interface window (GUI) similar, or the same, to "
"the one shown in Figure 1."

"Before using Qucs it is advisable to set the program application settings. "
"This is done from the **File** :math:`\\rightarrow` **Application Settings**"
" menu. Clicking on **Application Settings** causes the "
"**EditQucsProperties** window to be displayed, see Figure 2. Complete, with "
"appropriate entries for your Qucs installation, the **Settings**, **Source "
"Code Editor**, **File Types** and **Locations** menus."

"On launching Qucs a working area labelled (6) appears at the centre of the "
"GUI. This window is used for displaying schematics, numerical and algebraic "
"model and circuit design data, numerical output data, and signal waveforms "
"and numerial data visualised as graphs, see Figure 3. Clicking, with the "
"left hand mouse button on any of the entries in the tabular bar labelled (5)"
" allows users to quickly switch between the currently open documents. On the"
" left hand side of the Qucs main window is a third area labelled (1) whose "
"content depends on the status of **Projects** (2), **Content** (3), "
"**Components** (4) or **Libraries**. After running Qucs, the **Projects** "
"tab is activated. However note, when Qucs is launched for the first time the"
" **Projects** list is empty."

"To enter a new project left click on  the **New** button located on the "
"right above window (1). This action causes a Qucs GUI dialogue to open. "
"Enter the name of a Qucs project in the box provided, for example enter "
"*QucsHelpFig* and click on the **OK** button. Qucs then creates a project "
"directory in the ``~/.qucs`` directory. In the example shown in Figure 3 "
"this is called **QucsHelpFig_prj**. Every file belonging to this new project"
" is saved within the **QucsHelpFig_prj** directory. On creation a new "
"project is immediately opened and it's name displayed on the Qucs window "
"title bar. The left tabular bar is then switched to **Content**, and the "
"content of the currently opened project displayed. To save an open document "
"click on the **save** button (or use the main menu: **File** "
":math:`\\longrightarrow` **Save**). This step initiates a sequence which "
"saves the document displayed in area (6). To complete the save sequence the "
"program will request the name of your new document. Enter *firstSchematic*, "
"or some other suitable name, and click on the **OK** button to complete the "
"save sequence."

"As a first example to help you get started with Qucs enter and run the "
"simple DC circuit shown in Figure 3. The circuit illustrated is a two "
"resistor voltage divider network connected to a fixed value DC voltage "
"source. Start by clicking on the **Components** tab. This action causes a "
"combo box to be displayed from which a component group may be choosen and "
"the required components selected. Choose components group **lumped "
"components** and click on the first symbol: **Resistor**. Next move the "
"mouse cursor into area (6). Pressing the right mouse button rotates the "
"**Resistor** symbol. Similarly, pressing the left mouse button places the "
"component onto the schematic at the place the mouse cursor is pointing at. "
"Repeat this process for all components shown in Figure 3. The independent DC"
" voltage source is located in the **sources** group. The ground symbol can "
"be found in the **lumped components** group or selected from the Qucs "
"toolbar. The icon requesting DC simulation is listed in the **simulations** "
"group.  To edit the parameters of the second resistor, double-click on it. A"
" dialogue opens which allows the resistor value to be changed; enter *100 "
"Ohm* in the edit field on the right hand side and click enter."

"To connect the circuit components shown in Figure 3, click on the wire "
"toolbar button (or use the main menu: **Insert** :math:`\\longrightarrow` "
"**Wire**). Move the cursor onto an open component port (indicated by a small"
" red circle at the end of a blue wire). Clicking on it starts the wire "
"drawing sequence. Now move the drawing cursor to the end point of a wire "
"(normally this is a second red circle attached to a placed component) and "
"click again. Two components are now connected. Repeat the drawing sequence "
"as many times as required to wire up the example circuit. If you want to "
"change the corner direction of a wire, click on the right mouse button "
"before moving to an end point. You can also end a wire without clicking on "
"an open port or on a wire; just double-click the left mouse button."

"As a final step before DC simulation label the node, or nodes, who's DC "

"**R2**. Click on the label toolbar button (or use the menu: **Insert** "
":math:`\\longrightarrow` **Wire Label**). Now click on the chosen wire. A "
"dialogue opens allowing a node name to be entered. Type *divide* and click "
"the **OK** button. If you have drawn the test schematic correctly the "
"entered schematic should look the same, or be similar to, the one shown in "

"To start DC simulation click on the **Simulate** toolbar button (or use "
"menu: **Simulation** :math:`\\rightarrow` **Simulate**). A simulation window"
" opens and a sliding bar reports simulation progress. Normally, all this "
"happens so fast that you only see a short flickering on the PC display (this"
" depends on the speed of your PC). After finishing a simulation successfully"
" Qucs opens a data display window. This replaces the schematic entry window "
"labelled (6) in Figure 3. Next the **Components** :math:`\\longrightarrow` "
"**diagrams** toolbar is opened.  This allows the simulation results to be "
"listed.  Click on the **Tabular** item and move it to the display working "
"area, placing it by clicking the left hand mouse button. A dialogue opens "
"allowing selection of the named signals you wish to list, see Figure 4. On "
"the left hand side of the **Tabular** dialogue (called Edit Diagram "
"Properties) is listed the node name: **divide.V**. Double-click on it and it"
" will be transferred to the right hand side of the dialogue. Leave the "
"dialogue by clicking the **OK** button. The DC simulation voltage data for "
"node **divide** should now be listed in a box on the data display window, "
"with a value of 0.666667 volts."
